Introduction:
In this project, the developer has used Next.js with TypeScript and implemented code splitting, good naming conventions, and the atomic structure model. They have also used the Zustand package and understood server-side rendering and how to define types and interfaces.

Project Overview:
The second assignment in the project is a Todo list application that has several new functionalities. The developer has created a feature where any input added to the Todo list is added dynamically. They have also added a dropdown button functionality that allows users to click on a checkbox button to cross out completed tasks. This feature will carry over to the next assignment.

Assignment Three:
The developer plans to expand on this project by adding new features in the third assignment. When a user clicks on any item in the Todo list, they will be redirected to a new page. The page will display a picture and nutritional content of the item entered in the Todo list. To fetch this data, the developer has used the Nutritionix website.

Technical Implementation:
The developer has used Next.js, a popular React-based framework that supports server-side rendering and code splitting out of the box. They have also used TypeScript, a statically typed programming language that helps identify errors before the code is executed.

In addition to this, the developer has implemented the atomic structure model, which involves breaking down the code into smaller parts that can be easily managed and accessed. The code splitting feature has been implemented to ensure that the application loads faster by only loading the necessary code when needed.

The developer has also used the Zustand package, a state management library that helps in managing the state of the application. This package provides a simple API to create and manage states that can be accessed across components.

To implement server-side rendering, the developer has used the built-in capabilities of Next.js. This ensures that the application's initial load time is optimized, and the user can start using the application faster.

Lastly, the developer has defined types and interfaces to ensure that the code is more maintainable, easier to read, and error-free. This helps identify errors before the code is executed and makes the application more robust.

Conclusion:
In summary, the developer has created a Todo list application using Next.js, TypeScript, and the Zustand package. They have implemented several features, including code splitting, good naming conventions, and the atomic structure model. They have also understood server-side rendering and how to define types and interfaces. In the upcoming assignment, the developer plans to add new features that will enable users to view a picture and nutritional content of any item entered in the Todo list.
